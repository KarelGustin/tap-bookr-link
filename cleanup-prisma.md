# 🧹 Cleanup Guide: Remove Prisma & Restore Supabase

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your onboarding is broken because of Prisma changes. Here's how to fix it:

## 📋 Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. **Run the Restore Script in Supabase Dashboard**
- Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in
- Open your project
- Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
- Copy the entire contents of `restore-supabase-complete.sql`
- Paste it into the SQL Editor
- Click **Run** (▶️ button)

### 2. **Clean Up Prisma Files (Optional)**
Delete these files from your project:
```
prisma/
├── schema.prisma
└── migrations/
setup-remote-db.sql
setup-supabase-policies.sql
disable-rls-temporarily.sql
check-rls-status.sql
quick-fix-disable-rls.sql
test-database-connection.js
```

### 3. **Test the Fix**
- Go back to your onboarding page
- Type a handle (e.g., "test123")
- The availability check should work ✅
- The Continue button should be enabled ✅

## 🔍 What This Fixes

- ❌ **Permission denied errors** → ✅ **Working database access**
- ❌ **Broken onboarding** → ✅ **Functional onboarding flow**
- ❌ **Prisma conflicts** → ✅ **Clean Supabase setup**

## 🎯 Why This Happened

Prisma modified your database schema and RLS policies, breaking the permissions that were working before. This restore script brings back the exact working setup you had.

## 🚀 After the Fix

Your onboarding will work exactly like it did before:
- Handle availability checks ✅
- Profile creation ✅
- File uploads ✅
- All the features you built ✅

**Run the restore script now and your onboarding will work!**
